                <h1>Pacific Beach Homes for Sale</h1>
                <article>
                    <p><span>The weather. The Food. The Drinks. The Beach.</span> You are in love with it all and now you want to learn more about Pacific Beach homes for sale and the questions start flowing:
                    </p>
                    <h2>Can I afford a home in Pacific Beach?</h2>
                    <p>I know what you are thinking. You either assume homes in Pacific Beach are expensive, or you already know it!
                    <br><br>
                    But you want to look anyway.
                    <br><br>
                    You get what you pay for. Pacific Beach real estate is some of the most desired in the world. So yes, the prices are relatively high compared to the rest of the world. The median sales price for the first half of 2019 was $1,325,000 for houses and $535,000 for condos. But the demand has historically been so high that vacancy rates are extremely low and market appreciation has historically been positive. For a 5 year example, the median sales price for the first half of 2014 was $934,750 for houses and $439,000 for condos. This means that Pacific Beach homes tend to be great investments.

                    <br><br>
                    If you’re planning on <a href="https://pacificbeachhomes.com/buying-a-home-in-pacific-beach/">buying a home in Pacific Beach</a>, take a look at current prices by clicking on the Buy button in the menu above and then clicking on a property. You can use the mortgage calculator (near the bottom of a property page) to estimate what your monthly expenses for a home in Pacific Beach will be.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What types of homes are for sale in Pacific Beach?</h2>
                    <p>Pacific Beach consists of houses, townhomes, condos and multi unit properties (think of duplexes, all the way up to apartment complexes). The mixture of these types of homes range from neighborhood to neighborhood within Pacific Beach. Northern Pacific Beach is predominantly single family houses perched atop the foot of Mount Soledad. Central Pacific Beach has a mix of houses, condos and multi-family units. Crown Point has mostly single family houses, with a couple large apartment complexes and condos mixed in. Mission Beach has homes situated on smaller pieces of land, creating a very dense lifestyle with incredible proximity to the water.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Which Pacific Beach neighborhood is right for me?</h2>
                    <p>This part can be tricky. If you are not currently living in Pacific Beach, you need to spend time learning the <a href="https://pacificbeachhomes.com/what-neighborhood-in-pacific-beach-is-best-for-you/">neighborhoods of PB</a>, or trust a <a href="https://pacificbeachhomes.com/real-estate-agent-pacific-beach/">Pacific Beach real estate agent</a> to help you. Pacific Beach is very unique because there are several abrupt changes in living situations as you move from block to block.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s important to think about what you want in a home in Pacific Beach. The main draw of the town is that it has the longest boardwalk of any town in San Diego and has some of the best beaches. The restaurants, bars, shopping and outdoor activities are some of the best in San Diego and many people want to be close to all of the action. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, the popular beaches and strips of nightlife along Garnet Street and Mission Blvd can get crowded and loud. Living too close to the action could mean red cups (or worse) in your front yard, strangers stumbling around on your sidewalk, and feeling like you are back in college. Finding the right balance between your desired proximity to the water, safety, serenity and price for your specific situation, is the key.

                    <h2>Why Choose Pacific Beach Homes and Ryan Pearson?</h2>

                        “Why Should I use PacificBeachHomes when there are sites like Zillow?”
                        This is the most important question I asked myself when building the site. Zillow is an amazing website with tons of information. It revolutionized real estate by providing (what used to be private) information to anyone with access to the internet. Zillow has the entire US housing market mapped out. Even if a home is not for sale on the active market, you can see when it last sold, and for how much!
                        <br><br>
                        Zillow is a great site. I am not trying to compete with it. However, once you’ve decided on a specific neighborhood or town, like Pacific Beach, Zillow can’t give you behind the scenes insight on the community. Knowing about upcoming “off market” Pacific Beach homes for sale and a lifetime of experiences to share about the town is important! Algorithms predicting a “zestimate”, and a “walkscore” are nice, but there’s so much more to know about each neighborhood of Pacific Beach. This is where <a href="">PacificBeachHomes.com</a> comes in.

                    <h2>How Can Pacific Beach Homes Help You?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Talking to an experienced real estate agent with knowledge of the area is extremely important when buying or selling a home in Pacific Beach. Finding the right homes for sale in Pacific beach is important, whether it’s online or offline, but it’s only the first step. You need help with the real estate contracts, knowing how and when to negotiate, and the steps of buying or selling a home. You also want someone who knows more than the “property details write-up” about the house and area you are looking at.
